SnapshotBackup by Fredrik Welander
--------

This script uses hardlinks to create time freezed incremental backups. It is a reliable solution for automatically 
backing up multiple sources with maximum diskspace and bandwidth efficiency. 


**DISCLAIMER:**
This program may not work as espected and it may destroy your data. It may stop working unexpectedly or create useless backups. It may be a security risk.
Read and understand the code, test in a safe environment, check your backups from time to time. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

**COPYRIGHT:**
SnapshotBackup is released under GPL v3. Copyright Fredrik Welander 2013


**Features**
- Changes are backed up in time freezed snapshots using rsync and cp
- Only changes are backed up which saves both diskspace and bandwidth
- Runs in cron, so you can schedule your backups any way you like
- Works with both local and remote sources 
- The number of kept snapshots is freely configurable
- Has (optional) error reporting via email, reported errors include missing destination, backup already running and insufficient diskspace
- Keeps its own logfile and also saves a more detailed info file for each snapshot
- Keeps track of the backup drive's diskspace and the size of the backup sources
- Can (optionally) send an info email when the backup run is completed
- Preserves file ownership and permissions, but you can (optionally) also save the permissions to a separate file


**Syntax:**
```sh
snapshotbackup.bash [OPTIONS] SOURCE_PATH [SOURCE_PATH ...] DESTINATION_PATH
    
# Send test email message and exit:
snapshotbackup.bash -m
```     
**Options:**

-s, --snapshots *NUMBER*  
- Number of snapshots to keep 

-r, --rsync-args *ARGUMENTS*  
- Arguments to rsync (without dash prefix!) to override the script default `-a` (equals `-rlptgoD`)
- Example: `-r rlptD` - do not preserve group or owner
- Example: `-r aR` - preserve full paths

-m, --mail-on-complete  
- Send an email or Telegram message on backup completion. Sends test message to ERROR_MAIL if used without other arguments.

-p, --permissions
- Backup permissions separately with getfacl
    
**Installation:**
```sh
# Install dependencies (only rsync is required for basic use)
sudo apt-get install rsync mailutils acl sshfs

# Clone the script:
git clone https://github.com/subsite/snapshotbackup.git

# Symlink to executable path, for instance:
sudo ln -s ~/snapshotbackup/snapshotbackup.bash /usr/local/sbin/snapshotbackup.bash
```   
Optional step, if you want error reporting and don't want to put your email into the script file. Requires mail.mailutils:
```sh
# Create a file containing your email address:
sudo echo "your.email@mailprovider.com" > /etc/scriptmail.txt

# Send a test message with:
snapshotbackup.bash -m
```    
Test your new installation, for example like this:
```sh    
snapshotbackup.bash -m ~/Documents /tmp/backup_test
```
You should now have a bunch of snapshot-directories under `/tmp/backup_test` (`/tmp/backup_test/snapshot.0` containing your Documents-directory and the info file), and you should have received an email about the completed backup.


**Dependencies (standard shell commands not listed):**
- rsync 
- /usr/bin/mail (If you want error reporting by mail. Part of package mailutils. Recommended.)
- getfacl (If you need to backup permissions separately. Part of package acl.)
- sshfs (If you need to locally mount remote sources or destination. Not recommended.)

**Notes:**
- Run script as root to preserve file ownership and avoid permission errors, but protect your backup drive.
- Use double quotes around source dirs with spaces. Destination path cannot contain spaces.
- Source paths can be remote (user@client:/dir/dir) or local, but you cannot mix. All sources must be on the same host.
- Destination path must be on a locally mounted device.
- Backup destination must be a Linux type filesystem for the hardlinks to work, forget FAT/NTFS drives.
- For best results with Windows clients, install [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) with ssh on the client and use as a normal remote source.
- A locally mounted SSHFS/SMB/NFS source works technically, of course, but can be slow and/or unreliable. Remote (rsync) sources are recommended.
- SnapshotBackup has limited error handling. Killing a running script might make a mess.

**Security:**
- Make sure the backups are protected even if your main user account is compromised, restrict sudo access and use unique passwords for sudoers.
- Pull backup is recommended for security, push backup (with the destination sshfs-mounted) will make your backups available *and writable* if some person or malware gets access to your computer.
- Consider chmod 700 on the backup destination directory. This will make restoring a bit less smooth, but will keep the backups hidden from anybody without root access on the server.
- You could enable root login on your client sshd and use root@client:/source/path to get all read-only files (like private keys, /etc/shadow and such) but I find this unnecessary and risky, especially if the backup drive is unencrypted.

**Sample pull backup setup:**
- On client: Create a dedicated backup user or set a password for user 'backup' if it already exists. You can use a long randomly generated password and forget it after uploading the key. Note: the existing backup user doesn't have a shell on all systems, so if ssh throws "This account is currently not available", you need to create the shell with `root@client:# chsh -s /bin/bash backup`
- On server: Make sure the backup user can log in using ssh key authentication (do ssh-keygen, ssh-copy-id backup@client, etc). You might need to ssh-keygen for root@server and ssh-copy-id to backup@client as well.
- On server: Set up the backup command to run in cron (as root).

**Using reverse tunnels for offsite backups**

Say you have a computer at home (called *src*) and a computer at work (called *dest*) and you want to do offsite backups from *src* to *dst*, but both are on a dynamic IP and hidden behind NAT (and ipv6 not available). Luckily you have an account on a server (called *my.server.foo*) somewhere else, and permission to manage its firewall. 
1. On *my.server.foo*: Choose a port for your tunnel, let's say 22222. Set the firewall to allow incoming on this port.
2. On *src* (the backup source), start the reverse tunnel with     
`me@src:~$ ssh -f â€“R 22222:localhost:22 me@my.server.foo`    
3. On *dest* (the backup destination), test your connection to *src*    
`me@dest:~$ ssh -p 22222 me@my.server.foo`    
If everything works, you should now be able to log in to *src* using your credentials on that box.
4. Time to make the tunnel persinstent on *home*. First kill the tunnel from step 2, it was just for testing. Then install autossh daemonizing the connection:    
`me@src:~$ apt install autossh`    
Then enable key-authentication:   
`me@src:~$ ssh-copy-id me@my.server.foo`  
Add it to a cron script (every 5 minutes in this example):    
`*/5 * * * * me /usr/bin/autossh -M 20000 -N -o "ServerAliveInterval 60"  -o "ServerAliveCountMax 3" -R 22222:localhost:22 me@my.server.foo > /dev/null 2>&1`    
NOTE: The monitor port (-M 20000 in this case, you can use any available port) needs to be unique for every tunnel you run on the same host. Use 20001 for the next one.

5. On *dest*, add an entry to `~/.ssh/config` so you won't have to remember the port every time:
```
Host src
        HostName me@my.server.foo
        User me
        Port 22222
```
Now you should be able to connect from *dest* to *src* using just    
`me@dest:~$ ssh src`  
Remember to also add this entry to `/root/.ssh/config` if you run your pull backups as root.

You can now omit the username and port when running the pull backup:    
`me@work:~$ snapshotbackup.bash src:/home/me /mnt/backup_drive/mybackup`

**Examples**

*Make snapshots of three directories using default configuration (no options):*
```sh
snapshotbackup.bash backup@client:/etc backup@client:/home/user /mnt/backup_drive/mybackup
```
*Make snapshots of local /var/www keeping 30 copies using special rsync args and send mail on completion:*
```sh
snapshotbackup.bash -s 30 -r rlptD -m  /var/www /var/www_backup
# And the same using long options:
snapshotbackup.bash --snapshots 30 --rsync-args rlptD --mail-on-complete  /var/www /var/www_backup
```
*Sample pull backup in /etc/cron.d*
```sh
30 1 * * * root /usr/local/sbin/snapshotbackup.bash -s 14 -m backup@client:/etc backup@client:/home/user /mnt/backup_drive/client/daily
```
